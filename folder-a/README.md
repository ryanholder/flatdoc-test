Flatdoc in Folder A
=======

Flatdoc is a small JavaScript file that fetches Markdown files and renders them
as full pages. Essentially, it's the easiest
way to make open source documentation from *Readme* files.

 * No server-side components
 * No build process needed
 * Deployable via GitHub Pages
 * Can fetch GitHub Readme files
 * Gorgeous default theme (and it's responsive)
 * Just create an HTML file and deploy!

*Current version: [v0.9.0][dist]*

Getting started
---------------

Create a file based on the template, which has a bare DOM, link to the
scripts, and a link to a theme. It will look something like this (not exact).
For GitHub projects, simply place this file in your [GitHub pages] branch and
you're all good to go.
